coach-lesson-trumpf-vulnerability-exception = Note: being able to trump does not mean they will. A possible trump-in alone does not show that drawing trumps first would have been better; the rating of your move above is a separate model judgement.
coach-lesson-trumpf-vulnerability-transfer = Before you play an Ace or a Ten of a side suit: who plays after you, can they be out of that suit, and can they still hold trumps?
coach-lesson-partner-overtake-evidence = { $declarer } led { $best } as declarer; after your { $card } it still takes the trick. { $player } plays last.

       *[follow] with a higher card ({ $cards })
    }. { $certainty ->
        [certain] That is certain: whatever the concealed cards, { $player } holds such a card.
       *[possible] That is possible, not certain: it depends on cards you have not seen.
    }
coach-lesson-partner-overtake-rule = { $case ->
        [trumpf] Rule (ISkO): { $player } must follow with a trump if possible; only a higher trump wins.
       *[suit] Rule (ISkO): { $player } must follow { $class } if possible; then only a higher { $class } card wins. Without { $class }, any trump wins.
    }
