# Implement an issue

Issue number: `$ARGUMENTS`. If it is missing, ask for it (in CI, stop).

## 1. Understand

- Read the issue with `gh issue view <n> --comments`.
- Read `AGENTS.md` and the documents it lists that the issue touches. Their
  hard rules, SPDX headers, language rules and conventions are binding.
- Collect the issue's **checklist**: every task-list item (`- [ ]` /
  `- [x]`) in the issue body, typically the acceptance criteria. Track each
  item as a todo; they define "done".
- Unclear points: ask the user in a local session. Where nobody can answer,
  pick the most reasonable interpretation and document it (PR body, and a
  new D entry in `docs/decisions.md` if it is fundamental).

## 2. Implement

- Work on a feature branch from `main` (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`); never on
  `main`. Local default: `claude/issue-<n>`.
- Test-driven for rule engine and analysis code, as `AGENTS.md` requires.
- Update affected docs (vision, roadmap, decisions, third-party, glossary)
  in the same change.
- Commit in focused Conventional Commits, only when all checks pass.

## 3. Verify

Run every command under "Build and test" in `AGENTS.md` (once
`Cargo.toml` exists) plus `git diff --check main`. Fix everything you
introduced. Do not finish with failing checks.

## 4. Assess the checklist honestly

For each checklist item decide **done** or **not done**. An item is done
only if all of these hold:

1. It is fully implemented on the branch, not partly or as a stub.
2. You verified it: a passing test or command demonstrates it, or for
   documentation items you re-read the resulting file. Name the evidence.
3. Nothing it requires was deferred, skipped or left as a TODO.

Anything partial, untested, failing, unverifiable by you (e.g. needs a
human or external access) or uncertain is **not done**.

**Never tick an item to make the work look complete.** A wrongly ticked
item is worse than an open one: it hides missing work from the reviewer.
Leave items that others already ticked unchanged; if you think one does
not hold, say so in the PR body.

## 5. Tick the done items in the issue

Change nothing in the issue body except `[ ]` → `[x]` for items judged
done in step 4.

- Fetch the current body: `gh issue view <n> --json body --jq .body > current.md`
  (use a scratch directory, not the repository).
- Write `edited.md` with only those markers changed and check it with
  `python3 .github/scripts/merge-checklist.py current.md edited.md > merged.md`;
  it fails if anything besides checkbox state changed.
- Local session: apply with `gh issue edit <n> --body-file merged.md`.
- If the caller says where to write the edited body instead (CI does), write
  it there and do not edit the issue yourself.

## 6. Pull request

Title: one Conventional Commit line. Body: follow
`.github/pull_request_template.md` and add:

- `## Issue checklist`: every checklist item with ✅ or ❌ and its
  evidence (test name, command, file) or the reason it is open.
- Decisions taken without being able to ask.
- `Closes #<n>` only if every checklist item is done and nothing else in
  the issue remains; otherwise `Refs #<n>` plus a `## What remains`
  section.
- Tick the template's own checklist by the same honesty rule.
- End with the PR attribution line given by your environment.

Local session: push the feature branch; open the PR only when the user asks.
If the caller says where to write title and body instead (CI does), write
them there and do not push or open the PR.

## 7. Report

Summarise what was done, what is open (with reasons) and which checklist
items you ticked.
