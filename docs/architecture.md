# Architecture: `skat-core`

Crate layout and dependency direction are in [vision.md](vision.md#architecture-guideline).
This page fixes the decisions inside `skat-core` that analysis, AI, coach,
replay and frontends build on (D-20 to D-26, rule interpretations in D-28).
Keep it short; details belong in the code (`crates/skat-core`).

## Cards

- `Card` is an index `0..32` (`u8`); `Suit` and `Rank` are enums.
- `CardSet` is a `u32` bitset with set operations (union, intersection,
  count, iteration).
- Rationale: Monte Carlo and the double-dummy solver need cheap set
  operations and cheap cloning of whole game states.

## Game state and actions

- One state machine `Game` with a `Phase` enum, not one type per phase, so a
  simulator or search can hold any position in one type.
- Phases: `Reizen`, `SkatAufnahme` (Hand or pick up), `Druecken`, `Ansage`,
  `Spiel`, `Beendet`, `Eingepasst`. Kontra/Re is not a phase of its own (see
  below).
- API shape:

  ```rust
  fn current_seat(&self) -> Option<Seat>;
  fn legal_actions(&self) -> Vec<Action>;
  fn apply(&mut self, action: Action) -> Result<Vec<Event>, RuleError>;
  ```

- `apply` validates first and mutates only on success: a rejected action
  leaves the state unchanged. `validate` performs the same check without
  applying.
- `Action` and `Event` are plain enums. `RuleError` is a structured enum with
  no texts (D-13).
- Actions: `Bid(value)`, `Hold`, `Pass`, `Hand`, `TakeSkat`,
  `Discard(CardSet)`, `Announce(Announcement)`, `Play(Card)`, `Kontra`,
  `KeinKontra`, `Re`, `KeinRe`. They always act for `current_seat()`.
- Events carry only public information (no Skat, discard or hand cards,
  except the Ouvert reveal), so a frontend may show them to every seat.
- Rule helpers usable by analysis: `legal_cards`, `trick_winner`,
  `GameType::trumps`, `spitzen`.

## Kontra/Re in the flow (D-26)

- An eligible defender may choose `Kontra` instead of a card while it is their
  turn and they have not played a card yet. Only one Kontra per game.
- `Kontra` puts the game into a pending state in which the declarer's only
  legal actions are `Re` or `KeinRe`. Then play continues with the same
  defender.
- Ouvert: before the declarer's cards are revealed, each eligible defender
  decides once (`Kontra` or `KeinKontra`), followed by the declarer's Re
  decision if needed. Only then the cards are revealed and play starts.

## Determinism and replay

- A game is fully described by `(seed, RuleConfig, actions)`. Dealing is the
  only source of randomness in the core.
- RNG: `rand_chacha::ChaCha8Rng`, seeded explicitly. Not `StdRng`, whose
  algorithm may change between `rand` versions and would break old replays.

## Information sets

- `Game` holds the full state and is not handed to AI or coach.
- `Game::view(seat) -> PlayerView` contains only what that seat may know:
  own hand, bidding history, tricks played, the own discarded Skat (declarer
  only), and the declarer's cards in Ouvert games once revealed.
- Full knowledge only via an explicitly named type (`OmniscientView`) for open
  mode and post-game analysis, so its use is visible in signatures.

## Rules and scoring

- `RuleConfig { kontra_re: bool }`; further options only when decided.
- Game value, Überreizen and Seeger-Fabian are pure functions over a finished
  game: `settle(&GameOutcome) -> GameResult` and
  `GameResult::seeger_fabian()`, testable without playing a game.
- Seeger-Fabian returns the contribution of each seat for one game; series
  bookkeeping is not part of `skat-core`.

## Serialisation

- Public data types derive `serde` traits behind the cargo feature `serde`,
  so `skat-app` and replays can store them without forcing `serde` on every
  user of the core.
