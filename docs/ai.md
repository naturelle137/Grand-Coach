# Opponent AI: `skat-ai`

Strength levels of M4 (D-07, D-40): profiles, information boundary, the
calibration protocol and its results. Details are in the code
(`crates/skat-ai`).

## Calibration protocol

Written down before the first validation run. The tuning suite had
already been used for pilot runs at that point; the validation suite had
not.

- **Runner**: `cargo run --locked --release -p skat-ai --example
  calibrate -- <suite> <A> <B> <deals> <parallel> <first>`, headless,
  with the real engine, analysis and opponents (`skat_ai::arena`).
- **Rules**: ISkO with Kontra/Re on (D-03, D-26).
- **Suites**: deal seeds come from `ChaCha8Rng` streams with separate
  keys for tuning and validation, so the two never share deals. Tuning
  uses only the tuning suite. Each validation attempt uses a fresh block
  of validation deals (attempt 1: deals 0–199, attempt 2: 200–399, …);
  every attempt is reported.
- **Opponent seeds**: from a third key mixed with suite, deal index, game
  and seat; never derived from a deal seed.
- **Schedule**: each deal is played six times (`arena::SEATINGS`): A
  alone on Vorhand, Mittelhand and Hinterhand against two copies of B,
  then B alone on each seat. Each profile holds each seat, and so each
  dealer position, equally often, both as the lone player and as a pair
  of defenders.
- **Metric**: Seeger-Fabian points per seat-game, Einpassen included
  with 0 points for every seat. Per deal, D = mean of A's 9 seat-games −
  mean of B's 9 seat-games. Declarer and defender games, win rates and
  points per role are reported as supporting information.
- **Sample size**: 200 deals (1,200 games) for each adjacent pair (Easy
  vs. Medium, Medium vs. Strong) on the validation suite.
- **Uncertainty**: deals are independent; standard error of the mean of D
  over deals and a 95 % interval (normal approximation, mean ± 1.96
  standard errors).
- **Pass criterion**: for each adjacent pair, the 95 % interval of
  stronger − weaker lies entirely above 0. Otherwise the result is
  reported as inconclusive (or reversed) and calibration continues on the
  tuning suite before a new validation attempt.
