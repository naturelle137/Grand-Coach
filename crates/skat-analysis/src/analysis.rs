//! Option evaluation for every decision: Monte Carlo over the seat's
//! information set, double-dummy card play and the continuation policy.
//!
//! [`analyze`] takes one seat's [`PlayerView`] and nothing else (D-23). For
//! each hypothetical distribution of the hidden cards ([`World`]) it plays
//! every legal option to the end of the game:
//!
//! - the option itself is the only enumerated decision,
//! - every later decision before card play (bidding, Hand or pickup,
//!   Drücken, announcement, Kontra/Re) follows [`crate::policy`] with the
//!   deciding seat's own cards in that distribution,
//! - card play is double-dummy ([`crate::double_dummy`]),
//! - the finished game is settled by `skat-core`, including Überreizen and
//!   Kontra/Re.
//!
//! Results are averaged with the bidding-evidence weights
//! ([`crate::evidence`]). If the number of distributions does not exceed
//! the sample budget, all of them are enumerated and the result is marked
//! exact (exact over the hidden cards, under the same model). See
//! `docs/analysis.md` for semantics and budgets.
