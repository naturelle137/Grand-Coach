//! Evidence contract for coach lessons (D-53, `docs/analysis.md`).
//!
//! The analysis already reports exact facts ([`Observation`]), sample
//! summaries of the opponent model ([`Inference`]) and estimates. This
//! module adds what a lesson needs on top, without a second game or belief
//! model and without another search:
//!
//! - [`Evidence`]: the facts and sample summaries of one decision, each with
//!   its class and provenance ([`Source`]) in a decision [`Snapshot`]. It
//!   names no action, so it may be shown before the move (D-49).
//! - [`Comparison`]: after the move, whether the model comparison of the
//!   chosen option with the best one is reliable. Only a complete analysis
//!   with both options evaluated on every distribution is. It also carries
//!   the exact [`Mechanism`]s of the trick after the chosen card.
//! - [`Lesson`]: a stable, versioned lesson definition with applicability,
//!   permitted evidence classes, conditions, exclusions and an explicit
//!   support status. [`Lesson::check`] is the predicate; the coach only
//!   selects among lessons that apply.
//!
//! Hard knowledge and sample summaries stay apart: conditions on facts
//! match only [`EvidenceClass::Exact`] items. A sampled minimum is not a
//! proven bound, and a positive expected Trumpf count does not prove that
//! a place holds Trumpf.

/// 1. [`TRUMPF_VULNERABILITY`] (mechanism): after the seat's Ass or Zehn of
///    the led side suit, winning so far, an opponent playing later in the
///    trick can trump it, possibly or certainly (Farbspiel and Grand,
///    declarer and defenders).
/// 2. [`PARTNER_OVERTAKE`] (mechanism): a defender played second to the
///    declarer's lead without taking the trick; the partner, playing last,
///    can beat the declarer's card, possibly or certainly (Farbspiel and
///    Grand).
/// 3. [`PROVEN_VOID`]: a seat did not follow the led class in the trick in
///    progress or the last completed trick, so it holds no card of that
///    class (Farbspiel, Grand, Null). It teaches an exclusion only.
/// 4. [`REMAINING_TRUMPF`]: a Trumpf was played in the trick in progress or
///    the last completed trick; where the Trumpf are, as far as the seat
///    knows (Farbspiel and Grand; Null has no Trumpf). Unseen Trumpf are
///    not assigned to a seat.
///
/// 5. [`GAME_VALUE`]: before card play, from the seat's second bidding call
///    on and when deciding Hand or pickup or announcing: the value range of
///    each contract with the own cards (an unknown Skat counts for the
///    Spitzen) and the value the game must reach to avoid Überreizen.
/// 6. [`HAND_STRUCTURE`]: at the seat's first bidding call and when
///    discarding: own Buben, Trumpf and Spitzen per Farbspiel and Grand.
///
/// Neither names a game, bid or discard as better; both are exact.
///
/// Mechanisms apply after the move only, with a reliable comparison, and
/// never because the chosen option scored higher: they need the exact
/// mechanism of the chosen card. Older facts do not trigger the fact
/// lessons again, so the same fact is not repeated at every card.
