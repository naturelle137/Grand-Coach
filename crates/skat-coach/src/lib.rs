//! Live coach (M5): turns one [`Analysis`] of `skat-analysis` into a
//! structured [`Explanation`] (D-13): what to think about, which options
//! there are and how they compare, with the reasons the estimates give.
//!
//! The coach does not compute strategy of its own ("coach and AI do not
//! compute separately"): every fact is an analysis observation, every
//! inferred distribution an analysis inference, every comparison an
//! analysis estimate. The coach only ranks, groups and labels them by the
//! documented thresholds below (`docs/coach.md`, D-48). It returns no
//! texts; frontends translate the structure.
//!
//! No telling ahead (D-49): before the move a frontend shows only
//! [`Hints`], revealed stage by stage and never naming the best option;
//! after the move [`review`] judges the chosen action, and at the end of
//! the game [`moments`] picks zero to three teachable moments, one per
//! [`Concept`]. The player may choose one concept as focus; the coach
//! never diagnoses one.
//!
//! Information boundary: [`explain`] takes the deciding seat's
//! [`PlayerView`] and the analysis of exactly that view (D-23).
//!
//! Lessons (D-53): the analysis gathers the permitted [`Evidence`] and
//! checks lesson predicates ([`Lesson::check`]); the coach only selects a
//! lesson with [`teach`] and falls back to the model comparison when none
//! applies. [`lesson_content`] hands the cited facts of a taught lesson,
//! or the exact mechanisms of the chosen card, to the frontend as plain
//! data. Before card play these are the own hand structure and the legal
//! game values ([`LessonContent::HandStructure`],
//! [`LessonContent::GameValue`]), never a preferred bid, game or discard.
