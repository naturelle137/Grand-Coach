//! Opponents with strength levels (M4, D-07, D-40, D-41).
//!
//! A level is a [`Profile`]: how much analysis effort the opponent spends,
//! how much it deviates from the best option, how well it remembers played
//! cards and which mistakes it makes. Every strategic number comes from
//! `skat-analysis`; this module only picks one of the analysed options or
//! follows the shared rules of thumb ([`BaselineOpponent`]).
//!
//! Information boundary: [`Opponent::decide`] takes one seat's
//! [`PlayerView`] and nothing else (D-23). Its randomness comes from the
//! opponent's own seed and the view, never from the deal seed, so the same
//! view, seed and profile give the same decision. The only opponent with
//! full knowledge is [`crate::Mephisto`].
