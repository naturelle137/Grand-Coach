//! The Mephisto opponent (D-41): decides with every card known.
//!
//! It receives the whole [`Game`], so its use is visible in every
//! signature (D-23). Each decision is [`skat_analysis::analyze_known`] on
//! the real distribution: every option is played out exactly, card play
//! double-dummy, and the best option by [`crate::utility`] is chosen. Two
//! Mephisto defenders solve the same double-dummy game, in which the
//! defenders minimise together, so they play as one side.
//!
//! Bidding: the analysis values a bid with the other seats bidding by the
//! rules of thumb. Mephisto only says or holds a value if it also wins the
//! game when everybody else passes at once (checked exactly, with the
//! game it would then choose); passing is always allowed. As declarer it
//! therefore only plays games it wins double-dummy, against any defence.
